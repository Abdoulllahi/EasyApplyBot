# LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot

Automate your LinkedIn job applications with ease using this Python and Selenium-based bot. Tested successfully on over 15,000 job applications, this bot simplifies the Easy Apply process. Please note that the bot is provided without warranty, and usage is at your own risk. I cannot be held responsible for any consequences, including account restrictions or suspensions by LinkedIn. Consider it an educational and enjoyable project!

## Fork Notes

This bot is a fork from the previous maintainers' GitHub repository. It has been enhanced with additional features such as new skills, more answers, and the option to log the application submission date and time. With this functionality, you can even deploy a PowerBI dashboard to monitor the bot's performance using the CSV files generated by the bot.

## How-to Video

To assist you in setting up and using the bot, I have created a helpful video tutorial. Watch it here: [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/-eZJH5EdQr0)

## Setup & Startup

1. Start by configuring the `config.yaml` file. This is a one-time setup and contains the necessary inputs for running the bot. Take care not to change the formatting or add spaces in the file. Detailed explanations for each input can be found in the comments within `config.yaml`.

2. After configuring the file, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. Finally, run the bot using your preferred method:
   - If using an IDE like PyCharm Community Edition, execute `main.py` from your IDE.
   - If using the command line or terminal, activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`, then run `python3 main.py`.

If you encounter any "dependencies not found" errors, ensure that the dependencies are installed. You can confirm this using your IDE or, if using the command line/terminal, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before executing `python3 main.py` to start the bot.

### Common Error

IDEs like PyCharm sometimes conflict with the included virtual environment (venv) in this project. To resolve this, you can delete the `venv` folder and configure the Python interpreter to use the "local" option. Additionally, install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` to ensure a successful run of `main.py`.
